# CuoraLib - AVR Utilities
## Description
CuoraLib is a set of utility codes for AVR microcontrollers. I gathered some useful codes in my projects and made an interface for them to reuse. These code works well on ATmega328 and ATmega2560 microcontrollers. However, Because of the difference between AVR microcontrollers, these code may not work on all AVR microcontrollers, and you need to modify some code.  
For a more detailed description of these code, please read `README.md` in their own folders.  
The library was named after Cuora, a kind of turtle (Asian box turtle).
